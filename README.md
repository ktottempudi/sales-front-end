# sales-front-end

**Background**  
This is the User Interface on the salesOffice repo that is found here: [salesOffice](https://github.com/ktottempudi/salesOffice.git). This salesOffice repo will act as the backend will this repo will be the front-end. The two will communicate with each other through a series of API calls. This application was bootstrapped using create-react app

**Requirements**  
Node  
Create-React App  
react-router-dom  
salesOffice  

**Running The Application**  
After downloading the necessary requirements start by running your database server followed by deploying your back-end, which in this case is salesOffice. After downloading this repository use the following command to run the front-end: **npm start**. This command will start running the front-end on port 3000. Replace the server port API calls to the back-end from here with your designated port number. The front-end and backend will communicate using JavaScript's built-in fetch API. 

**Functionality**  
This project will give the user the ability to perfrom CRUD operations on an employee database that was designed in the back-end. The results of those changes will then be displayed back to the user.
